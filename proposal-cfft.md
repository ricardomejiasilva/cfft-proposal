# Business Proposal
## Digital Services Exchange for Flight Training

**Prepared for:** Central Florida Flight Training  
**Prepared by:** Ricardo  
**Date:** February 2026

---

## Executive Summary

I'm a full-stack developer and co-founder of WingAI, a mobile app with **2 million downloads**, **$100k monthly recurring revenue**, and **1.5 billion user-generated content views**. I'm pursuing my Private Pilot License and would like to propose an exchange: my professional digital services in return for a credit toward flight training at CFFT.

This proposal outlines specific improvements to your online presence that will generate measurable results—more leads, better conversion, and increased revenue—while requiring zero upfront investment from you.

**The Exchange:** $30,000+ in professional digital services in return for my complete Private Pilot License training at CFFT.

## Current Website Assessment

After reviewing centralfloridaft.com, I've identified several opportunities for improvement:

| Area | Current State | Impact |
|------|---------------|--------|
| **Hosting** | WordPress.com (limited) | Restricted customization, slower performance, less professional |
| **Booking** | Phone/email only | Friction = lost leads. Modern students expect instant scheduling |
| **Lead Capture** | None | Visitors leave without a way to follow up |
| **SEO** | Minimal optimization | Missing local search opportunities (Tampa, Wesley Chapel, etc.) |
| **Social Proof** | No reviews displayed | Trust signals missing—critical for high-ticket purchases |
| **Mobile Experience** | Basic | 60%+ of traffic is mobile; needs optimization |
| **Automation** | Manual processes | Time spent on admin instead of instruction |

### The Opportunity

Flight training is a **$10,000–$15,000+ purchase decision**. Every potential student who visits your site and leaves without taking action is a significant missed opportunity. Even converting **one additional student per month** represents $120,000+ in annual revenue.

### What You're Getting

| The Exchange | Details |
